This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).
## Blogging 
Check the structure of ./src/_posts/ for details.

General idea:
Each post needs a title, date and recap, then the content follows.
## Dev

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Pages are in app/

## Deploy
```bash
npm run deploy
```
after adding and committing everything, npm will build and deploy to gh-pages, while pushing the content to main
