<p>I still remember the first time I am in the FullStack class.</p>
<p>It was a weird feeling for me. I have always been trying to get into
web dev but has never been successful. Everytime I tried it, I always
a roadblock with the html and css and never even got to JavaScript.</p>
<p>I signed up for the class because my dearly supervisor Carol from Fermilab had told me that
she needed a website built. No more, no less. My line of thinking was "hey, if there's
a time to get into web dev again, it is right here, right now."</p>
<p>And there I went...</p>

<p>It was crazy how fast we were doing it. And when I say crazy, I mean like
the class was 3 unit, and we were introduced to html, css and javascript in like 3 weeks,
and then off we go to build a website. The instructor Sebi would walk us through the slides
and then he would go on these little demos, show-casing these knowledge into</p>
<h2 id="but"><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" href="#but"><a href="#but" style="margin-right: 10px">#</a></a>But</h2>
<p>It was fun. For the first time doing web-dev, it was actually enjoyable (hahaha).</p>
<p>I still remembered the first time I started writing my first personal website. It was crazy
how fun it is. I was staying up soo late just to get the colorscheme right and the flex property right.</p>

<p>It was great, everyday I was looking forward to building my website again.</p>
<p>But it was hard. Code wasn't actually maintainable. CSS is not the way to go and
pure JSS is too much.</p>
<p>I turned to NextJS and TailwindCSS for comfort :'(</p>
<p>Then it was fun again, I started rebuilding my website with NextJS and TailwindCSS,
eventually deploying it on top of my old personal website. The React-based framework
combined with the ultility-based CSS framework meant that I was writing code faster and
easier than ever before, tripling or quadruple my development speed compared to when I
was developing the old website.</p>
<p>Then it suddenly hit me. I was feeling a little down. Seeing my old website being replaced
by a new, more modern website left a bad taste in my mouth.</p>
<p>It was weird; I had been associating the old website with something
that would be with me forever. I was bragging it to everyone. To Erica, to Emi,
to Aeriel, to Don, to everyone. I knew then when I was writing the old website that
I would need to turn to a newer tool but it still hurt so much having to say
goodbye to my first little child.</p>
<p>It was sad, I was very sad. But just like in life, saying "goodbye" and let go
might be the wiser choice...</p>
