<p>This article will include the summary of my contribution, where you can find all my filed issues and PRs.</p>
<h2 id="introduction"><a href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>This summer I worked on the <a href="https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs">gccrs</a> project, a GCC Front-end for Rust.</p>
<p>gccrs is a project to implement the Rust programming languages from scratch in the GCC codebase in order for rust to be able to be compiled to a wider amount of targets. It currently targets the version 1.49 of Rust and is supported by Open Source Security and Embecosm.</p>
<p>By doing this, it helps with a couple things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Targets architecture not available with rustc due to the use of LLVM. (SuperH for example, which powers the Dreamcast!)</li>
<li>Benefit from the existing GCC ecosystem.</li>
<li>Help with acceptance of Rust in the Linux kernel</li>
<li>Help with acceptance of Rust in other fields, where having multiple compilers helps.</li>
<li>Enable building Rust on targets with very old C++ compilers! (Targets with at least GCC version 4.8 (which released March 22, 2013) can build Rust)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="main-contribution-aspects"><a href="#main-contribution-aspects">Main contribution aspects</a></h2>
<p>Overall, I contributed in 3 main aspects:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>My main project</strong> - Inline Assembly in rust: I programmed the parser, set up the code infrastructure for TREE IR generation in the backend, along with AST, HIR lowering and typechecking.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>CI/CD</strong>: I helped maintain and improve the CI/CD pipeline. This includes resolving dependency issues in GitHub Actions, adding support for 32 bit CI and glibc compliance CI.
I also created a docker-compose dev environment for MacOS-based contributors, with all libraries and dependency installed; this helps us bypass MacOS's annoying build and link issues.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Code maintainance/Bug Fixes/Code Review</strong>: I maintained the code base via issues filed by my mentor and other contributors. I also helped fix some minor bugs in IR lowering and typechecking. I also help review some new, simple PRs for contributors.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The closed/filed rate is 4/8, which is not high. Through out writing the parser and the backend infra, I realized that there are these little issues that's just easier to just fix and not necessary filed. There is also issues that are discussed via <a href="https://gist.github.com/badumbatish/9823719ef359a58b131220d9d79d2aec">hackmd notes</a> between me and my mentor that are not necessarily filed via GitHub.</p>

<p>The merged/filed rate is 22/25. Half of the PRs are easy to fix / fixable within a short amount of time (Code maintanence aspect). The other half is medium in difficulty, related to my summer project (Project aspect).</p>
<h2 id="introspection"><a href="#introspection">Introspection</a></h2>
<p>Thinking back about the summer internship, I think I wasted a lot of time setting up dev envs, compiling and testing codes. Coding and building gcc/gccrs on a Macbook really sucks since the build step is confusing and there isn't a clear guide on how to do it. Compiling and testing requires a lot of time and for a person with ADHD, everytime I press that <a href="https://github.com/badumbatish/brt.nvim">&#x3C;space>b</a> button, my mind goes to YouTube and Discord and it really disrupts my flow; I wish getting ADHD meds in America was easier.</p>
<p>As past Jasmine used to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>idk its just hard to do stuff, i'm programming and it takes like x to compile and y minutes to test so i can't focus and then i go and change sth to test out my theory i have to wait like a bit for it to compile and test and then i just don't have any ideas cause i forgot them already and then an email comes in or a zulip msg comes in from my mentor and then fuck now i check them and then i was like "ok now what do i do" then the cycle continues</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, I did learn a lot. I learned how necessary it is to let the compiler do the work for you and how to design the software / compiler in a way that takes advantage of this as much as possible. This also applies to general stuff in my day to day tasks. Another thing is learning and using your tooling very well. This applies to <a href="https://github.com/badumbatish/dotfiles">neovim, git, bash shell</a>, <a href="https://github.com/badumbatish/gccrs-workspace"> docker </a>, etc etc etc; A more in-depth mastery of these tools allows me to iterate the development cycle faster and save more time to browse cute transbian on twitter :)</p>
<h2 id="end-words"><a href="#end-words">End words</a></h2>
<p>It's been a blessing to contribute to gccrs this summer (and get paid for it hehe). I am mentored by Arthur Cohen and Pierre-Emmanuel "PEP" Patry; Arthur helped me with the direction of the project and code reviews while Pierre-Emmanuel provided me with code infrastructure navigation and PR code-reviews, both of which are much needed.</p>
<p>I am looking for internships/new grad gigs for 2025 in compiler and would love to connect with new people and be informed of new opportunities. Please contact me at either:</p>
