## Prologue
Hi everyone, wow, it's been a quick minute since I last updated my blog. The article is to new people who might be
asking:

"Ok, I've done the [llvm tutorial](https://llvm.org/docs/tutorial/MyFirstLanguageFrontend/index.html) already.
What's next?" More specifically, the article is about adding primitive support for error reporting to the
toy compiler.

As is tradition :) I also wanna share some songs with you. The two songs are [Valentine]() and [Into my arms](),
both by COIN, one of my fav band.

I hope you enjoy :) (both the songs and the blog hahah)
## Introduction

Compiler diagnostics is an important aspect in one's compiler. From erroring out on the programmer's mistake to
providing warnings, the ability to accurately locate the location of the pesky problems to said
programmer is proven to be very valuable.

The article then discusses a way to improve upon the llvm Kaleidoscope toy compiler in the diagnostic aspect to the
user.

## Tokens

Let's start with the tokens and the lexer. When given the source code as a string (maybe via a file), the lexer
scans from left to right on that string, each time updating the index on that input string and returning a token.
This is the basis of our class Location.

```cpp
class Location {
    size_t internal_index = 0;
    // todo, Jasmine please doooo thissss
    // override ++ operator
    // override -- operator
    // override == operator

    // override | (to combine multiple Location)
    // int overload
}
```
