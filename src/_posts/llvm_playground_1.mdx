recap: "Jasmine starts learning LLVM (again)" 
---

Hi everyone, it's Jasmine here, or `badumbatish`.

Inspired by mcyoung's llvm ir blog and sha4dy's learning llvm blog, I think it'd be great to write some kind of similar blog posts, albeit I'm still learning :)

In this blog post, let's try to get a minimal running example of LLVM running/

We'll get started by installing LLVM, write a CMakeLists.txt, and create a main.cpp to generate
a `main` function that returns 0

# Installing llvm

LLVM is a very well-known compiler framework so chances are you wouldn't have to build it from source and just install it from your favorite package manager.

On my MacOS, I'll use homebrew to install llvm

```bash
brew install llvm
```

On MacOS, for some reason CMake fails to recognize and find LLVm via `find_package()` so 
you would have to configure it with some extra steps

Then when you run
```bash
brew info llvm
```

It'll spit out some extra information about linking flags for you
```bash
➜  badumbatish.github.io git:(main) ✗ brew info llvm
==> llvm: stable 18.1.8 (bottled), HEAD [keg-only]

==> Options
--HEAD
        Install HEAD version
==> Caveats
To use the bundled libc++ please add the following LDFLAGS:
  LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib/c++ -Wl,-rpath,/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib/c++"

llvm is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked into /opt/homebrew,
because macOS already provides this software and installing another version in
parallel can cause all kinds of trouble.

If you need to have llvm first in your PATH, run:
  echo 'export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc

For compilers to find llvm you may need to set:
  export LDFLAGS="-L/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/lib"
  export CPPFLAGS="-I/opt/homebrew/opt/llvm/include"
