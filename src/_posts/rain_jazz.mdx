recap: "Short form paragraph about Jasmine's rain."

It has rained every day since Jazz was here.

Doing math? RAIN.

Eating dinner? RAIN.

Walking to the park? RAIN.


Everything she did, it felt like the sky was raining. One day, she brought an umbrella just in case,
and it stopped. She wondered if she missed the rain or not. Should she just not bring the umbrella, so there is rain in her eyes one last time...
