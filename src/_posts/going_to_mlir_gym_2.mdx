[Please, please, please](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAgVtzhjfCA&ab_channel=SabrinaCarpenter-Topic) don't read
it now. It's unfinished :)

## Prologue
Hi everyone, I hope everybody's been great :) I hope you like my last report for my graduate class [here](https://badumbatish.github.io/posts/going_to_mlir_gym_1). This article is also related to the same project. It
discusses the
SSA linear scan
register
allocation algorithm and the steps taken to implement it.

Just like the last MLIR report post, I also include a supporting section (SS) right before the introduction for
unfamiliar
reader in the compiler space.

Without reading the SS, I assume interested readers are familiar with some basic middle-end IR concepts (e.g $\phi$
notation, liveness analysis, loops).

With reading the SS, there is some context from the last report's [SS](https://badumbatish.github.io/posts/going_to_mlir_gym_1#reader-supporting-section) that I think would be helpful.

And as is tradition, I also wanna share a [song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5HFyoxqUi0g&ab_channel=CROWONHYENAS) for
you to listen to while reading. Initially it was between this song and [that](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-LKgloPswQ&ab_channel=hazardclique) song. What can I say? I guess this is a long form way to say I want you to listen to
both :)

I hope everybody enjoys :)


## Reader supporting section
- Dominance: In a CFG, with the entry basic block $BB_0$ and any two basic block A and B, if all paths from
$BB_0$ to B goes through A, then A is said to dominate B. The notation for dominance is A
$\gg$ B and every node is said to dominate itself.

- Dataflow analysis: Abstractly, dataflow analysis is a way to understand how data moves and changes throughout a
computer program.
It helps us track what happens to different values (like variables) as the program runs from start to finish.

For example, when [reaching definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reaching_definition) is
run, the compiler can detect if some variable is possibly uninitialized and warn us if such cases appear:
```rust
fn reaching_def_example(condition: bool) {
    let x: i32; // x is declared but not initialized

    if condition { // if this `if` condition is `false`,
       x = 5;      // `x` is not initialized
    }

    println!("{}", x); // Warning: x might be uninitialized
                      // if condition is false
}
```

- Loop header: In hand with dominance, a block is said to be a loop header if it dominates one of its
predecessors (a block that points to it). Knowing what a loop header is, and later identifying it would be of great
help in
our live intervals (of our linear register allocator) construction. As in the paper by Wimmer and Franz, their live
intervals construction bypasses the dataflow analysis cost itself, simply on the concept of dominance and loop header.

Before heading further, let's look at an example for the two concepts.

In this control flow graph, A dominates every BB, including itself.
B dominates D; even though there is a path from
D to B, it must have first passed from B first. Since B dominates its predecessor, B is a loop header; hence,
there is a loop :)

D is:

- Live interval: (TODO: ordered linked list kinda thing)

## Introduction

Register allocation is an important aspect in the compiler construction phase.
Registers being the fastest
(but most limited) in the memory hierarchy, the compiler's register allocator must be strategic about this
resource, more usages in registers instead of the stack means reduced latency and
improved execution speed.

In the case of our recompiler, the main motivation related to obfuscation. [Edu](https://farena.in/)'s employer,
[Quarkslab](https://www.quarkslab.com/) is interested in applying obfuscation method to DEX files. With the methods
generating a lot of virtual registers, there were concerns about it exceeding the limit of $2^{16} = 65,536$ virtual
registers. In this case, the linear register allocation project helps bring down the number of virtual registers under
the limit (of course they can just run less obfuscation hahahah).

Personally, this is also another opportunity for me to improve my compiler arsenal. Most undergraduate compiler
classes leave this part out or only as part of a pen and paper exercise; knowing how to perform register allocation
(and writing about it)
would be a big push in the direction.

All discussed concepts are driven from the links in the resources section.

## Planning
We're planning to improve the lowering of MjolnIR to smali. What this means is that instead of lowering with
`template<class Aspect> class SmaliCounter{:cpp}`
Plans out stuff, discuss api.

- scc iterator : https://llvm.org/doxygen/classllvm_1_1scc__iterator.html

- mlir gets block sorted by dominance (not enough, not strict enough ordering)

- need to also detect loop
https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~fischer/cs701.f14/finding.loops.html

The procedure will be

- Linearize the blocks of CFG based on dominance, with blocks in the loop being the same.

- Construct the live ranges (with live holes).

- Construct the

### Algorithm
#### Topo sort with loop continuity
```cpp

auto topo_blocks = mlir get blocks sorted by dom;
auto order = map that maps order to block
auto result = {};
for each block b in topo_block
    if already in result
        continue
    else
        if exist a back edge from e to b


```
#### Building live intervals
```cpp
using LiveRange = std::pair;
DenseMap<Value, Vector<LiveRange>> build_intervals(MethodOp op) {

}
```
