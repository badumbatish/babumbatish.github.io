title: 'What I did for GSoc 2024'
date: 2024-08-22
recap: "The article is a report of what Jasmine's done for her Google Summer Of Code"
---

Hi everyone, this article is a requirement for my GSoc Final Submission, linking directly to the submission.

This article will include the summary of my contribution, where you can find all my filed issues and PRs.

## Main contribution aspects

This summer I worked on the [gccrs](https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs) project, a GCC Front-end for Rust.

Overall, I contributed in 3 main aspects:

- **My main project** - Inline Assembly in rust: I coded up the parser, set up the code infrastructure for TREE IR generation in the backend, along with AST, HIR lowering and typechecking. 

- **CI/CD**: I helped maintain and improve CI/CD pipeline. This includes resolving dependency issues in Github actions, adding support for 32 bit CI and glibc compliance CI.
I also created a docker-compose dev environment for MacOS-based contributors, with all libraries and dependency installed; this helps them (and myself) bypasses MacOS's annoying build and link issues.

- **Code maintainance/Bug Fixes/Code Review**: I maintained the code base via issues filed by my mentor and other contributors. I also helped fix some minor bugs in IR lowering and typechecking. I also help review some new, simple PRs for contributors.

## Issues and PRs
Below is all the issues, PRs and commits I've made to the [gccrs](https://github.com/Rust-GCC/gccrs) repository, up to Aug 22 2024, after producing this I ended up closing some resolved issues that has been silently addressed in some PRs.

The tables are produced via `gh` cli tool and some `I use nvim btw` love :)

## End words

It's been a blessing to contribute to gccrs this summer (and get paid for it hehe). I am mentored by Arthur Cohen and Pierre-Emmanuel "PEP" Patry; Arthur helped me with the direction of the project and code reviews while Pierre-Emmanuel provided me with code infrastructure navigation and PR code-reviews, both of which are much needed.

I am looking for internships/new grad gigs for 2025 in compiler and would love to connect with new people and be informed of new opportunities. Please contact me at either:
- tanghocle456@gmail.com (for job posting)
- jjasmine@berkeley.edu (for job posting)
- https://x.com/thisisjjasmine (if you like sapphic posting and compiler content)
 

Thank you for reading :)
